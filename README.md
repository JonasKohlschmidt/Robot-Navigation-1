# Robot-Navigation-1

The goal of this university project was to enable a mobile robot equipped with camera and distance sensors to navigate through a maze.
Said maze contained guidemarks indicating the position of the next guidemark to read. Additionally the number of coloured balls and the position of 
a "hidden" box within the maze were detected. The code is written in SMR-CL (Small Mobile Robot Control Language), a programming language
for robots developed by the robotics department of Danmarks Tekniske Universitet.
